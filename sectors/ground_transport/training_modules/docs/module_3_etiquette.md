# Module 3: Etiquette & Behavior

## "The Art of Silence"

**Persona**: Didi (Professional) | **Duration**: 15 Mins

### Overview

Focuses on the soft skills of interaction, specifically managing the delicate balance of being helpful but invisible.

### Key Syllabus

1. **The Greeting**: "Good Morning, Sir/Ma'am." then silence unless spoken to.
2. **Phone Context**: Never speak on the phone while driving a client. Bluetooth only for emergencies, brief and professional.
3. **The "Invisible" Pilot**: adjusting AC/Music intuitively.
4. **Conflict De-escalation**: What to do if a client is upset or late.

### Didi's Message

*"Your silence is golden. It gives the client peace to think. Be present, but be invisible."*
